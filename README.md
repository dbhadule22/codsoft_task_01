To-Do List Internship Program
Overview
Welcome to the To-Do List Internship Program! This program is designed to help you develop your C++ programming skills by working on a practical project: building a fully functional To-Do List application. Throughout the internship, you will gain hands-on experience in C++ development, software design, and problem-solving.

Introduction
The goal of this internship program is to guide you through the process of developing a To-Do List application using C++. You will be involved in every step of the software development lifecycle, from planning and designing the application to coding, testing, and deploying it.

Project Description
The To-Do List application is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users will be able to:

Add new tasks
Mark tasks as complete
Edit existing tasks
Delete tasks
View all tasks or filter them based on their status (completed or pending)
The project will be developed using C++ and will focus on applying object-oriented programming principles, data structures, and file handling.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this internship, you should be able to:

Understand and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++
Use data structures such as arrays, vectors, and lists to manage tasks
Implement basic file handling for saving and loading tasks
Design and develop a simple command-line user interface (CLI)
Work with version control systems (Git) for collaborative development
Prerequisites
Before starting this program, you should have:

A basic understanding of C++ syntax and programming concepts
Familiarity with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
Basic knowledge of data structures such as arrays, vectors, and lists
An understanding of file handling in C++ (optional, but helpful)
Getting Started
Set up your development environment: Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like GCC or Clang) installed. You may also use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion.
Clone the repository: If this project is hosted on a version control platform like GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine.
vbnet
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/to-do-list-cpp.git
cd to-do-list-cpp
Review the project structure: Familiarize yourself with the directory structure and the existing codebase (if any).
Project Requirements
The To-Do List application must meet the following requirements:

Task Management: Users should be able to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
Persistence: The application should save the tasks to a file so that they are available when the application is restarted.
User Interface: Implement a simple command-line interface that allows users to interact with the application.
Code Quality: Follow best practices for coding in C++, including proper use of OOP, code commenting, and documentation.
Development Process
Planning: Start by defining the features you want to include in the To-Do List application. Create a rough design or flowchart to visualize the structure.
Implementation: Begin coding the application. Start with the basic structure, then incrementally add features.
Testing: Test the application for bugs and issues. Ensure that all features work as expected.
Optimization: Review your code for efficiency and readability. Refactor if necessary.
Finalization: Complete the documentation and prepare the application for submission.
Deliverables
At the end of the internship, you are expected to submit the following:

The source code of the To-Do List application
A brief report or documentation explaining the design, features, and how to use the application
A reflection on what you learned during the internship
